# Crypto App Full Stack Website

I did this web application to sharpen my full stack development skills.

It is a simple Crypto website where you can see all of your favorites coins

The goal of this project was to :
  - Build a web application in REACT
  - Learn how to use API
  - And then deploy it

The application is available here : cryptocurrencies-app-mbaurin.netlify.app
